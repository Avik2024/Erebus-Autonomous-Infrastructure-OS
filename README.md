# 🌌 Erebus – Autonomous Infrastructure OS
<img src="./images/erebus.png" alt="Erebus Image">
Erebus is a next-generation **Autonomous Infrastructure Operating System** designed for cloudless, distributed computing.  
It brings together concepts from **Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, and monitoring** into a unified, self-healing platform.  

Erebus is a next-generation Autonomous Infrastructure Operating System designed for cloudless, distributed computing environments. It unifies the power of modern infrastructure management by integrating concepts from Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, and comprehensive monitoring into a single, self-healing, and intelligent platform.
Our vision for Erebus is to revolutionize how distributed systems are managed, moving towards a truly autonomous model where infrastructure provisions, scales, and repairs itself without human intervention, ensuring unparalleled resilience and efficiency.

✨ Features (Planned)
Self-Healing Capabilities: Automatic detection and resolution of infrastructure failures.
Autonomous Resource Allocation: Intelligent scaling and optimization of resources based on demand and predefined policies.
Unified Control Plane: A single interface to manage compute, storage, and networking across diverse environments.
Declarative Infrastructure as Code: Leverage familiar tools like Terraform and Helm for defining desired states.
Real-time Observability: Integrated monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) for deep insights into system health and performance.
Multi-Cloud & Edge Support: Designed from the ground up to operate seamlessly across different cloud providers and edge locations.
AI-Driven Optimization: Future integration of AI for predictive scaling, anomaly detection, and advanced self-optimization.
